## Issues, Challenges encountered and Etc.

1. When an entry is focused in the chat functionality, the name of the person you're chatting with goes up.
2. Google Sign In and Sign up buttons has a shadow on its frame so that to hide the image not filling up the full width and height of the frame.
3. Show button is a boxview and a label because the text in button is given a padding.
4. When a cell in the contacts list view is tapped, it's background color changes for a brief moment showing the gaps between the upper and lower cells since.
5. After debugging I see a message saying "skipped frames".
6. I don't know where to put the code that fires everytime there is a document change.
