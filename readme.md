# Chat App

This is a mobile chat application developed under Xamarin Forms. Despite the name Forms, I've only developed for Android.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

In the Android Manifest, the minimum android version is Android 5.0 (Lollipop) and the target version is Android 9.0 (Pie)

#### Installing

1. Open your browser and go to https://i.diawi.com/ad4xRB.
2. Type the password : 1234567890 and submit.
3. Click install application under the installation category.
4. Allow neccessary permissions and download. Remember where you've put the apk file. 
5. A warning appears at the bottom of the screen saying it can harm your device, press the "Ok" button.
